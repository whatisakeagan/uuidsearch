## Purpose
This project enabled customer service representatives to troubleshoot bank integration issues with significantly increased speed by way of eliminating the need to manually search for UUIDs and their respective issues in Github. There were hundreds of issues in the respective repository, many of them created automatically by a monitoring bot, with information only a specific team would be able to parse. To facilitate issue reporting between this team and the customer service team in order to resolve customer issues much more quickly, this eliminated the guesswork/automated comment text with pertinent details in issue reporting for the customer service team and allowed engineers to easily see what issues were affecting most the customers.
